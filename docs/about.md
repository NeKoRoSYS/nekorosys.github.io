# About Me

Hello there, I am NecroMarX! You can call me Necro for short, or even Marky, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am an aspiring graphic designer, sofware developer, and game developer. I made this website for the sole purpose of making a personal space for my creations for everyone interested to see!
