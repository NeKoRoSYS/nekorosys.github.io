# My Projects

*   [NecroMarX's HardCore Mobs Add-on](docs/projects/hardcore-mobs) - This addon makes most of the hostile mobs on the overworld and nether dimensions almost indestructible and incredibly difficult to deal with. It's mainly the fact that they are much faster which turns everything into a greater challenge, but if that wasn't enough, they also have much more powerful attacks. For example, most of the mobs cause twice as much damage. <a href="https://mcpedl.com/hardcore-mobs-addon" target="_blank">View at MCPEDL</a>

*   [NecroMarX's Supernaturals v1.9.5](docs/projects/supernaturals) - The Supermaturals Add-on introduces new items, materials, blocks, and two factions of extremely dangerous mobs. Supernaturals are hostile toward any friendly beings they come across, and most of their stats have been drastically buffed compared to the usual vanilla Minecraft monsters! Most features are under development and may lack textures and will most likely have bugs, be sure to stay tuned for more updates in the future! <a href="https://mcpedl.com/the-vampires-addon" target="_blank">View at MCPEDL</a>
